<p className="graph">This is my first coding bootcamp and I'm still trying to figure this out. This portfolio is a screen shot of the last 6 months. I will be linking some of my challenges that I've completed throughout the course. I've learned a lot about Web Development, and I'm looking forward to practicing my skills. </p>
